Apache Software Foundation Parent POM

    This project consists of a POM that contains settings that are
    likely to be useful to any Apache project that is building and
    releasing code with Maven. By using this project as a parent,
    a project gets these settings.

    Most projects will want to override some of these settings.

    The following is a list of the items configured in this POM:

 * Top-level project properties:
    
  ** <<license>>: {{{https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt}Apache-2.0}}.
    
  ** <<organization>>: ${project.organization.name}
    
  ** <<url>>: {{<<<https://www.apache.org/>>>}}. You should override this.
    
  ** <<repositories>>: Optional: the pom adds the Apache snapshot
     repository ({{<<<https://repository.apache.org/snapshots>>>}})
     This only happens if the <<<apache.snapshots>>> property is set,
     or the <<<use-apache-snapshots>>> profile is active.
    
  ** <<distributionManagement>>: The POM sets up for releases to the Apache Nexus
     instance at
     {{<<<https://repository.apache.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2>>>}}
     and snapshots to
     {{<<<https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots>>>}}.\
     Note that there are <<<distMgmt(Releases|Snapshots)(Name|Url)>>> POM properties (<<<distMgmtReleasesName>>>, <<<distMgmtReleasesUrl>>>, <<<distMgmtSnapshotsName>>> and <<<distMgmtSnapshotsUrl>>>)
     that you can override to change the names and locations.
    
  ** <<mailingLists>>: The POM sets up generic Apache announcement
     lists. You should override this.

 * <<pluginManagement>>: The plugin management section specifies versions
    of a list of plugins. See the {{{./plugin-management.html}Plugin Management report}} for
    the complete list with versions. 

  ** There are used properties <<<version.\<artifactId\>>>> for defining each version of plugin, except:

   *** <<<version.apache-resource-bundles>>> is used for: <apache-jar-resource-bundle> and <apache-source-release-assembly-descriptor>

   *** <<<version.maven-plugin-tools>>> is used for: <maven-plugin-annotations>, <maven-plugin-plugin> and <maven-plugin-report-plugin>

   *** <<<version.maven-surefire>>> is used for: <maven-failsafe-plugin>, <maven-surefire-plugin> and <maven-surefire-report-plugin>

   []

  ** The compiler plugin is set target <<Java $context.get("maven.compiler.target")>> (<<<maven.compiler.target>>> property)
     and assume $context.get("project.build.sourceEncoding") source encoding (<<<project.build.sourceEncoding>>> property). When being executed
     with JDK 9 or newer also <<<maven.compiler.release>>> is set to the value of property <<<maven.compiler.target>>>.
     Therefore its value must not start with <<<1.>>> (use for example <<<8>>> instead of <<<1.8>>>).
    
  ** The jar plugin is set to add default specification and implementation entries.
    
  ** The resources plugin is set for $context.get("project.build.sourceEncoding").
    
  ** The release plugin is set, via the

    *** <<<\<releaseProfiles\>>>> configuration element, to enable the <<apache-release>> profile during <<<release:perform>>> execution

    *** enable <<<\<autoVersionSubmodules\>>>>

    []

 * <<plugins>>: The plugins section configures three executions:
    
  ** maven-remote-resources-plugin for {{{/apache-resource-bundles/jar/}org.apache.apache.resources:${resourceBundleArtifact}:$context.get("version.apache-resource-bundles")}}.

    *** The value of <<${resourceBundleArtifact}>> is defined in a property called <<<resourceBundleArtifact>>>. Using the default value for this property will create a {{{/apache-resource-bundles/jar/}Apache JAR Resource Bundle}}

    *** Changing the property value to <<apache-jar-txt-resource-bundle>> will create a {{{/apache-resource-bundles/jar-txt/}Apache JAR (.txt) Resource Bundle}} instead

   []

  ** maven-enforcer-plugin to check Maven and Java build prerequisites, configured via properties:
 
    *** <<<minimalMavenBuildVersion>>> property: default value is <<Maven $context.get("minimalMavenBuildVersion")>>

    *** <<<minimalJavaBuildVersion>>> property: default value is <<Java $context.get("minimalJavaBuildVersion")>>

    []

 * <<Reproducible Builds>>: since version 22 of this parent POM, managed plugins versions are expected to be compliant with {{{https://reproducible-builds.org/}Reproducible Builds}}.

   To choose their own release timestamp in output archives, projects using this POM as parent should override with a property in their root POM:

+------+
  <properties>
    <project.build.outputTimestamp>10</project.build.outputTimestamp>
  </properties>
+------+

   The value will be updated by Maven Release Plugin during releases. If a project wants to disable Reproducible Builds, just define
   the property value with any single non-numeric character.

   In version 34, Reproducible Central Report is added to report on Reproducible Builds checks for the project and it dependencies.

 []

The <<<apache-release>>> Profile

   As noted above, this pom configures the release plugin to enable
    the <<<apache-release>>> profile for all executions of the release
    plugin.

   The profile includes the following plugins:

 * maven-assembly-plugin

    {{{/apache-resource-bundles/source-release/}org.apache.apache.resources:apache-source-release-assembly-descriptor:$context.get("version.apache-resource-bundles")}}
    is added as dependency, and an execution is configured with <<<source-release-assembly>>> id.\
    The plugin is configured to take a <<<descriptorRef>>> name from the
    <<sourceReleaseAssemblyDescriptor>> property, which by default is
    set to <<<source-release>>> (zip only): you can override the property with
    <<<source-release-zip-tar>>> (both zip and tar) or <<<source-release-tar>>> (tar only) values.\
    If you want to avoid this default assembly execution to provide your own mechanism to produce the source release archive,
    you can disable the execution by configuring <<<skipAssembly>>> parameter for this <<<source-release-assembly>>> execution id

 * maven-source-plugin

   Configured to build and attach a source jar.

 * maven-javadoc-plugin

   Configured to build and attach a javadoc jar.

 * maven-gpg-plugin

   Configured to sign everything.

   On developer workstations it expects GnuPG agent to be available to get passphrases,
   while on fully unattended (CI-like) workflows the use of <<<MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE>>> environment variable use is recommended.

 * checksum-maven-plugin

   Configured to create a checksum file(s) for source release as
   required by {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution#sigs-and-sums}Apache release distribution policy}}.

 []

  When doing a release with maven-release-plugin, this creates files in <<<target/checkout/target>>> ready
  to be copied to projects' {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution}Apache <<</dist/>>> release distribution}}
  directory:

 * <<<$\{artifactId\}-$\{version\}-source-release.[zip|tar.gz]>>>: the source release archive(s)

 * <<<$\{artifactId\}-$\{version\}-source-release.[zip|tar.gz].sha512>>>: their checksum(s)

 * <<<$\{artifactId\}-$\{version\}-source-release.[zip|tar.gz].asc>>>: their signature(s)
 
 []

 Those files also end up in the staging repository and Maven Central.

Settings Configuration
  
  You can have a look at the page in Apache website
  {{{https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html}Publishing Maven Artifacts}}.

  You can test your environment setup using <<<-Papache-release>>> with the command line.

Notices

 * Since version <<32>> <<<maven-site-plugin:attach-descriptor>>> was removed from <<<plugins>>> section.

   Publishing a site descriptor is only needed in project parent poms, child projects not need publish it.

   When you need publish site descriptor in your project you should add, like:

+------+
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-site-plugin</artifactId>
      <inherited>false</inherited>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <id>attach-descriptor</id>
          <goals>
            <goal>attach-descriptor</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+------+

 * Since version <<34>> <<<repositories>>> section has been moved to the <<<use-apache-snapshots>>> profile.

   Apache snapshot repository is now optional, and is only added when the profile is activated.

   It can be activated by setting the <<<apache.snapshots>>> property or activating the <<<use-apache-snapshots>>> profile directly.
