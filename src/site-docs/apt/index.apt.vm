Apache Software Foundation Parent POM

    This project consists of a POM that contains settings that are
    likely to be useful to any Apache project that is building and
    releasing code with Maven 3 (Maven 2.x is not supported any more since version 17). By using this project as a parent,
    a project gets these settings.

    Most projects will want to override some of these settings.

    The following is a list of the items configured in this POM:

 * Top-level project properties:
    
  ** <<license>>: Apache License, version 2.0.
    
  ** <<organization>>: The Apache Software Foundation
    
  ** <<url>>: {{<<<https://www.apache.org/>>>}}. You should override this.
    
  ** <<repositories>>: The pom adds the Apache snapshot
     repository ({{<<<https://repository.apache.org/snapshots>>>}})
    
  ** <<distributionManagement>>: The POM sets up for releases to the Apache Nexus
     instance at
     {{<<<https://repository.apache.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2>>>}}
     and snapshots to
     {{<<<https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots>>>}}. Note
     that there are POM parameters (<<<distMgmtSnapshotsName>>> and <<<distMgmtSnapshotsUrl>>>)
     that you can override to change the snapshot location. 
    
  ** <<mailingLists>>: The POM sets up generic Apache announcement
     lists. You should override this.
    
 * <<pluginManagement>>: The plugin management section specifies versions
    of a list of plugins. See the {{{./plugin-management.html}Plugin Management report}} for
    the complete list with versions. 
    
  ** The compiler plugin is set to default to <<Java $context.get("maven.compiler.source")>> and $context.get("project.build.sourceEncoding") source.
    
  ** The jar plugin is set to add default specification and implementation entries.
    
  ** The resources plugin is set for $context.get("project.build.sourceEncoding").
    
  ** The release plugin is set, via the
    \<arguments\> configuration element, to enable the
    <<apache-release>> profile for <<all>> executions and to disable
    \<useReleaseProfiles\>.  You can remove this with an empty
    \<arguments/\> element in the configuration of the release plugin.

 * <<plugins>>: The plugins section configures two executions:
    
  ** maven-remote-resources-plugin for {{{/apache-resource-bundles/}org.apache:apache-jar-resource-bundle:1.4}}.

  ** maven-site-plugin:attach-descriptor

The <<<apache-release>>> Profile

   As noted above, this pom configures the release plugin to enable
    the <<<apache-release>>> profile for all executions of the release
    plugin.

   The profile includes the following plugins:

 * maven-assembly-plugin:
    {{{/apache-resource-bundles/}org.apache.apache.resources:apache-source-release-assembly-descriptor:1.0.6}}
    is added as dependency, and an execution is configured with <<<source-release-assembly>>> id.\
    The plugin is configured to take a <<<descriptorRef>>> name from the
    <<sourceReleaseAssemblyDescriptor>> property, which by default is
    set to <<<source-release>>> (zip only): you can override the property with
    <<<source-release-zip-tar>>> (both zip and tar) or <<<source-release-tar>>> (tar only) values.\
    If you want to avoid this default assembly execution to provide your own mechanism to produce the source release archive,
    you can disable the execution by configuring <<<skipAssembly>>> parameter for this <<<source-release-assembly>>> execution id

 * maven-deploy-plugin: configured to activate <<<updateReleaseInfo>>>

 * maven-source-plugin: configured to build and attach a source jar.

 * maven-javadoc-plugin: configured to build and attach a javadoc jar.

 * maven-gpg-plugin: configured to sign everything. It expects to find
    a passphrase in <<<$\{gpg.passphrase\}>>>, presumably in your <<<settings.xml>>>.

 * checksum-maven-plugin: configured to create a checksum file(s) for source release as
    required by {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution#sigs-and-sums}Apache release distribution policy}}.

 []

  When doing a release with maven-release-plugin, this creates files in <<<target/checkout/target>>> ready
  to be copied to projects' {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/release-distribution}Apache <<</dist/>>> release distribution}}
  directory:

 * <<<$\{artifactId\}-$\{version\}-source-release.[zip|tar.gz]>>>: the source release archive(s)

 * <<<$\{artifactId\}-$\{version\}-source-release.[zip|tar.gz].sha512>>>: their checksum(s)

 * <<<$\{artifactId\}-$\{version\}-source-release.[zip|tar.gz].asc>>>: their signature(s)

Settings Configuration
  
  You can have a look at the page in Apache website
  {{{https://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html}Publishing Maven Artifacts}}.

  You can test your environment setup using <<<-Papache-release>>> with the command line.
